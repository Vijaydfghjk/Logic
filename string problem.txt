Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.


package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func jadenCase(text string) string {
	words := strings.Split(text, " ")
	capitalizedWords := []string{}
	for _, word := range words {
		if strings.HasPrefix(word, " ") {  // HasPrefix mean "vijay" HasPrefix checking the first charter capital or not 
			capitalizedWords = append(capitalizedWords, word)
		} else {
			capitalizedWords = append(capitalizedWords, strings.Title(word))
		}
	}
	return strings.Join(capitalizedWords, " ")
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(jadenCase("i love programming languages"))
	fmt.Println(jadenCase("they don't understand"))
}


?
/*

1.HasPrefix mean "vijay" HasPrefix checking the first charter caps or not.

2.first charter if not caps go to else block strings.Title(word)) this will change as capitalizedWords.(Vijay)


3.capitalizedWords like =  ILoveProgrammingLanguages like this 
  strings.Join(capitalizedWords, " ") by doing this space will come.
